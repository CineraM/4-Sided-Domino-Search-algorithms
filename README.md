# 4-Sided-Domino-Search-algorithms  
Uninformed, Informed, local search algorithms that solve the 4-sided dominio problem  

Implemented each algorithm in python. USF class Project, basic Helper functinos were provided by Dr. M.Pamplona (Professor)  


Explanation: 
Given a NxN set of tiles with four sides and one number from 1 to 9 in each side. 
Arrange those pieces to form a square in a way that the numbers in adjacent tiles are the same. Tiles cannot be rotated.
